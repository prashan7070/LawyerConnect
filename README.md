## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get LawyerConnect up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher**
*   **Maven** (for Spring Boot backend)
*   **A database** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL ‚Äì H2 is used for development by default)
*   **A web browser** (for the frontend)

### Backend Setup (Java Spring Boot)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/LawyerConnect.git
    cd LawyerConnect/backend
    ```

2.  **Configure Database:**
    *   Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `application.yml`).
    *   Update the database connection details if you're not using the default H2 database.
        ```properties
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:lawyerconnectdb
        spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
        spring.datasource.username=sa
        spring.datasource.password=password
        spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
        spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
        ```
        For PostgreSQL example:
        ```properties
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/lawyerconnect
        spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
        spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
        spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
        spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
        ```

3.  **Build the Project:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4.  **Run the Backend Application:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend will typically run on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup (HTML, CSS, JS)

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend # If you are in the backend directory
    ```

2.  **Open in Browser:**
    *   Simply open the `index.html` file (or your main HTML file) in your preferred web browser.
    *   Ensure that your JavaScript code correctly points to the backend API endpoints (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
